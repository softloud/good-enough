## Our Enterprise Ethic

We charge a high rate for enterprise work.  
Why? Because the stakes are high—and because we redistribute.

Your consulting fee helps support women of colour researching systemic injustice.  
You’re not just buying technical expertise.  
You’re underwriting a lab that values epistemic justice, not just ESG branding.

Get in touch to scope an ESG-aligned system architecture, FAIR data audit, or change-management plan rooted in epistemic integrity.

## Systemic Injustice Research Partners

> The singularity is here, its chaos must be governed.

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab offers special rates to research groups with needs in reproducible data science. 

Get in touch to discuss your work in systemic injustice, in any domain. 

### We want to fund women of colour in the Global South whose voices need to be heard 

> We’re building a lab where women of colour researching epistemic injustice are funded, heard, and centred.

Our launch Systemic Injustice Research Partner is Dr Garima Gupta. She has things to say about biodiversity conservation strategy that need to be heard. We build her structured intelligence systems according to reproducible scientific practices, where we develop our methodologies. 

Our dream is to fund our Injustice Partner's research, too, so that they can focus on important things, rather than wasting their time on postdoc and grant apps in a broken farce of meritocracy where all chips are stacked against them.

## Mentorship sought from senior women

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab is seeking mentorship/collaborators from senior women in:

- Grant applications; how do we fund Good Enough Data & Systems Lab's Systemic Injustice Research Partners?
- Industry partners: Dr Gray **needs** to work on the largest scale data platforms to apply her methodologies, it's simply more fun to design.
- *Charles needs to figure out her EU citizenship via Holocaust descendent and it's very traumatic for many reasons, please send help*

We are building solutions in R, Python, and DBT/Dagstar/Cloud-oriented, and because we implement, theory development is slow. But we are reading theory to understand how to make structured intelligence systems interpretable to humans, who then can govern the ethics of the system thinks. 

And what we are building is really powerful. The math works. 

> What the world needs now is not innovation, but **inclusively-opinionated automation**.

Charles doesn't know women who know more about these things than she does, and that's a problem. She is also seeking mentorship in these things.

- Statistical Consulting: for our Systemic Injustice Research Partners
- Applied Category Theory: Test and system architecture.
- Applied Chaos Theory: Measuring emergence in data systems.
- Model Theory: How to ensure everyone on the team understands the question, as it recursively changes through development? 
- Epistemic Injustice: How do we partner with critical theorists to help us design rules of care and commitment? Test-driven development. What should we test?

> We have the tools, 

> we have the math. 

> We just need the will to 

> **make systems care about people**.
