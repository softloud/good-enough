# Introduction

Data development begins and ends with people—or data development stalls.  
The complexity of data systems is not just a **technical** challenge; it is a **human** one.  

At **Good Enough Data & Systems Lab**, we advocate for an **opinionated, test-driven approach** that prioritizes:  

✅ **Democratizing knowledge** → Ensuring all stakeholders can meaningfully contribute to data products.  
✅ **Parallelizing development** → Structuring workflows so that bottlenecks are eliminated.  
✅ **Prioritizing developer and analyst wellbeing** → Recognizing that sustainable, high-quality data work requires ethical treatment of both people and data.  

🚀 **This is not just an alternative to conventional data strategies—it is a necessary shift toward scalable, ethical, and transparent AI & data governance.**

# 🏗️ Opinionated, Test-Driven Data Development  

A **test-driven approach** ensures that data development remains **structured, reproducible, and verifiable**.  

### 🔹 **Why Test-Driven Data Development?**
🔹 **Prevents Questionable Analytical Observations (QAOs)** → If data lineage isn’t tested, analysis results cannot be trusted.  
🔹 **Encourages Transparency** → Automated tests act as living documentation, reducing siloed knowledge.  
🔹 **Reduces Data Debt** → Catching problems early prevents technical debt from accumulating.  

### 🔹 **How This Works in Practice**  
**1️⃣ Define "Version 0" of a Data Product**  
   - Establish **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) validation criteria.  
   - Scope minimal requirements for productionalization.  

**2️⃣ Automate Data Quality Tests**  
   - Implement **test-driven data lineage** to ensure transformations produce expected results.  
   - Design **edge-case simulations** to validate statistical robustness.  

**3️⃣ Treat Analytics as Software**  
   - Version-control dashboards and prevent **ad-hoc analysis drift**.  
   - Use **simulation-based validation** to test statistical models under different conditions.
