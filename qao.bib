	abstract = {In order to provide responsible access to health data by reconciling benefits of
data sharing with privacy rights and ethical and regulatory requirements,
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) metadata should be
developed. According to the H2020 Program Guidelines on FAIR Data, data should
be “as open as possible and as closed as necessary”,
“open” in order to foster the reusability and to accelerate
research, but at the same time they should be “closed” to
safeguard the privacy of the subjects. Additional provisions on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data have been
endorsed by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Reg (EU)
2016/679, that came into force in May 2018. This work aims to solve
accessibility problems related to the protection of personal data in the digital
era and to achieve a responsible access to and responsible use of health data.
We strongly suggest associating each data set with FAIR metadata describing both
the type of data collected and the accessibility conditions by considering data
protection obligations and ethical and regulatory requirements. Finally, an
existing FAIR infrastructure component has been used as an example to explain
how FAIR metadata could facilitate data sharing while ensuring protection of
individuals.},

	abstract = {The continued thrust to increase competitiveness and shorten time-to-market in industry, and the more recent effort to “reinvent” the procurement process in government, has created sustained pressure to adopt new paradigms for aerospace projects. The banner of “faster, cheaper, better” places emphasis on use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems and components, Non-Development Items (NDI) (previously developed products that are not commercially available), and advanced, lightweight components. This paper reviews two successful and two unsuccessful projects, examining the processes they followed compared to the “traditional” approach used from the 1960s through the 1990s. We use a model of the technical aspects of the project cycle (the “Vee”) to highlight the essence of the processes followed, as well as the risks to be managed. The results illustrate that, without a valid and comprehensive process, “faster and cheaper” does not automatically lead to “better,” and, conversely, that an intelligently tailored process can greatly improve the success rate for “faster, cheaper, better” projects.},

These techniques are relevant to all of us with an interest in being skilful and accurate reasoners. In this highly accessible book, Peter Smith presents a guide to the fundamental aims and basic elements of formal logic. He introduces the reader to the languages of propositional and predicate logic, and then develops formal systems for evaluating arguments translated into these languages, concentrating on the easily comprehensible 'tree' method. His discussion is richly illustrated with worked examples and exercises. A distinctive feature is that, alongside the formal work, there is illuminating philosophical commentary. This book will make an ideal text for a first logic course, and will provide a firm basis for further work in formal and philosophical logic.},

	abstract = {An introduction to category theory as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language that can be used across the sciences.Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines.Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs—categories in disguise. After explaining the “big three” concepts of category theory—categories, functors, and natural transformations—the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions.Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.},
