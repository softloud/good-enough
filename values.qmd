Dr Charles T. Gray,  Datapunk and Mooncake (Impostor Syndrome) created the Good Enough Data & Systems Lab with two purposes.

##  What the lab is

This Lab is for those care about structured intelligence governance, mathematically defined ethics for what the zeitgeist means when they say *artificial intelligence* and *technological singularity*.

This is the Miranda that has burned up my brain.

And I aim to misbehave.
 
## What the lab is not

The Lab is opposed to ungoverned, developer-traumatising, flashy AI/ML-hype proof of concept hacks that immediately break.
