The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab collaborates with game studios by applying category theory and abstract mathematics to their JIRA development plans to optimise development strategy toward desired outcomes of  

- developer wellbeing
- efficiency
- reliability
- trustworthiness
- and most of all, human intentionality in a chaotic system.

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab develops and publishes on a categorically-defined *structured intelligence governance* framework with collaborators, creating a virtuous cycle between research and industry.
