The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab collaborates with game studios by computationally applying category theory and abstract mathematics to codebases and digraph-oriented game development (e.g., JIRA) plans. The Lab uses a mix of category theory, visualisation, and data simulation to explore frameworks such as  

- player behaviour
- developer wellbeing
- efficiency
- reliability
- trustworthiness
- expectation
- and most of all, human intentionality in a chaotic system.

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab develops and publishes on a categorically-defined *structured intelligence governance* framework with collaborators, creating a virtuous cycle between research and industry.
