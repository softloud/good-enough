> The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab was created to diagnose the harm created by misapplied algorithms.

We are a collective of data scientists and ethicists who care about finding solutions to the chaos of humans interoperating with automata and metrics. 

---

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab collaborates by computationally applying category theory and abstract mathematics to codebases and digraph-oriented development (e.g., JIRA) plans. Any graph-oriented or flat data structure has potential to be aggregated.


The Lab uses a mix of category theory, visualisation, and data simulation to explore frameworks such as  

- user behaviour
- developer wellbeing
- efficiency
- reliability
- trustworthiness
- expectation
- and most of all, human intentionality in a chaotic system.

A key priority is to to have *no* disruption on developer workflow, the Lab works at a metalevel on existing plans, well-masked human resource database extraction, and codebase metadata to provide strategic analyses.

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab develops and publishes on a categorically-defined *structured intelligence governance* framework with collaborators, creating a virtuous cycle between research and industry.

Under development - here's what's coming:

- data simulation animations of singularities failing
- time-series analysis on real-world data
- two papers
- slides
- a narrative adventure game 
- simulations on the narrative adventure game
- category-theoretic analysis on development of the narrative adventure game
- proof-sketches to discuss with applied category theorists
