## Mathematically-rigorous architecture + empathy = development strategy

The [Good Enough](career.qmd) Data & Systems [Lab](lab.qmd) researches and implements **trauma-informed** [development strategy for data](data) and [mathematically-rigorous computational systems](systems.qmd), while prioritizing developer wellbeing in a way that efficiently meets data governance objectives.

# Good Enough Solutions

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab conceptualises solutions as knowledge ecosystems of artifacts such as published manuscripts, websites, code, anlayses, and interactivity. 

## People + Data + Systems - Structure = Bad Data

It's not enough to explain the burnout of experienced by people who work with data, you have to experience it to understand it.

**Press a Button Now** is the proof, and **[motivating manuscript for the Good Enough Data & Systems Lab](link goes here)** is the theorem.  


## 🚨 Questionable Analytical Observations (QAOs)  


A core concept in the Lab’s philosophy is **Questionable Analytical Observations (QAOs):**  
🚨 **If data is compromised at the source, every downstream decision is questionable.**  
🚨 **If an AI system lacks structural rigor, its outputs cannot be trusted.**  
🚨 **If people working on a system are burned out, governance and quality will fail.**  


Governance **must begin at the point of observation,** not as an afterthought.  

# Good Enough Methods

## **🔢 Abstract Algebra + Systems Architecture**  

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab specializes in two core **technical** areas:  

✅ **Good enough data governance proofs** via **tests & documentation**.  
✅ **Good enough mathematical systems** for **narrative game design**.  

These **two domains** create a **virtuous research & implementation cycle,** bridged by:  

- **Data simulation** as a governance validation method.  
- **Random number generators** as the statistical backbone of procedural systems.  

Mathematical rigor, **when combined with an empathetic development approach,** ensures that computational systems remain **both precise and adaptable.**

## **🧑‍💻 People + Systems Strategy**  

🚀 **The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab is a place for data, people, and computational systems to be good enough—all at the same time.**  

📌 The Lab solves **problems in data and game development** using **trauma theory** to inform **agile development strategy**.  
📌 The Lab applies **abstract algebra & systems architecture** to design **structured, scalable, and resilient** computational workflows.  
📌 If we **do not** prioritize the **workflows of the people building and interacting with these systems,** then **innovation stagnates.**  

💡 **Good governance is not just about rules. It is about designing systems that respect both computational logic and human needs.**

## **🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack**  

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab is **tool and language agnostic** with two graph-oriented exceptions.   

📌 **To protect against the trauma of unconscious bias, the Lab is JIRA-oriented**—as it is a **graph-structured** data analytics tool designed for agile development.  

DBT core's relational structure for data engineering also is preferred as it is not only graph-based but open source with a thriving community.

Graph-defined tools. 

Beyond this, the Lab **prioritizes**:  
✅ **Open-source, interoperable tools**  
✅ **Actively maintained, community-driven ecosystems**  
✅ **Technologies that align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles**  

🚀 **Tools should support structured thinking—not create additional complexity.**
