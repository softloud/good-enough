# Cultural identity

When I meet people in Denmark, they invariably say, 

> You're Australian? *Put another shrimp on the barbie*!

But Australians call them *prawns*, and what we put on the barbeque are sausages&mdash;*snags* in Australian [Ocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocker)&mdash;so it's more accurate to say, *put another snag on the barbie*.

*Crocodile Dundee* (1986) [@faiman_crocodile_1986] is a bit confused about Australian identity [^1].

[^1]: To be fair, I've never actually seen *Crocodile Dundee*, and this line is the only thing I know about the film.

*Australians* are confused about Australian identity. 

Here's how it goes when I meet another Australian.

> Nice to meet you, Charles. And where do you come from? 

> Melbourne.

> I mean, where do you *really* come from? 

> Melbourne.

> No, I mean, where were you *born*?

> Melbourne.

> But, where were your *parents* born? 

> Melbourne.

> Well, where were *their* parents born? 

And here's where it gets a bit tricky. Because the only *real* Australians are Aboriginals, the rest of us got off the boat pretty recently. But if I were to ask

> Where the fuck were *your* grandparents born?

I'd be rude.

So, to make sense of my Jewish Chinese-Transylvanian Australian diasporic identity, I enrolled in cultural studies&mdash;because the only way to sort *that* out was to read essays written in the 1970s by a Palestinian-American deconstructing 19th century opera [@said_orientalism_2014]. 

I found myself in philosophical seminars. Some theorist would deliver a dense analysis of Elizabeth Bishop's treatment of the villanelle in her poem *One Art* [@bishop_complete_1983] to be met with a pompous question from some git in the audience, 

> [Yes, but *h*what is your *ontology*?](2025-04-16-one-art.qmd)

I've never felt very comfortable with terms like *ontology* and *epistemology*, can never seem to pin down their meaning. My understanding of [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) is that it is *the study of being*, how the existence of a thing is defined&mdash;which, frankly, has never once helped me catch a train. 

# Professional identity

I graduated into the [global financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis) of the late 2000s. 

So, the world didn't even give me a job to identify with, and told me my education was less than worthless.

It was time for pragmatism; I decided to get a 'real' job, be an accountant&mdash;or somesuch. 

I enrolled in a mathematics degree to learn how to crunch numbers.

Here's where mathematics starts you off:

> Suppose there [exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_theorem) an $x$,

and, worse still,

> Let the **[identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function)** define the map from $x$ to $x$.

---

But the longer you stay in mathematics, the more grounded it becomes. 

Mathematics becomes a guide for answering real-world questions, such as,

> What is the correct dosage to treat this condition? 

and 

> How do we ensure the trains run on time? 

# Answering questions

You might be vaguely familiar with current methodologies for answering questions with real-world data&mdash;heard these mentioned in passing, once or twice:

- algorithms;
- statistics;
- data science;
- machine learning;
- large language models; and
- artificial intelligence.

You know, grrl talk.

I've been doing grrl talk with data&mdash;in research, start-ups, and corporate&mdash;for nigh-on 15 years.

And now I've seen how it's done, I'm here to say,

> I have no earthly idea how the trains run on time. 

# Mind your Ps & Qs

To understand how broken data methodology is in practice, think of a question like this:

> given we have some data, then we may conclude this result,

formally speaking, 

$$
p \implies q,
$$

which reads as, 

> if $p$, then $q$.

A company (all companies) may wish to know, given our previous revenue, how much money will we make next year?

Suppose they made 2 million in the first year, 1 million in the second, and 3 million in the third. We might take the average and say fourth-year profit will be somewhere around 2 million&mdash;hedging our bets.

So the $p$s here are previous annual revenue data points, and the $q$ is the estimate for next year.  

Easy, right?

# The modern data stack

But data now arrives in billions of rows each day. The bigger the company, the more data, the more complex the *stack* [^2].

[^2]: 'A modern data stack is a collection of tools and cloud data technologies used to collect, process, store, and analyze data. All the tools and technologies in a modern data stack are designed to handle large volumes of data, support real-time analytics, and enable data-driven decision-making.' [@prakash_what_2023]   

It’s now necessary to have stacks of people to solve the equation:

- gather the $p$s (data engineers);  
- produce the $q$s (business analysts and data scientists); and  
- carry the $p$s to the $q$s (platform engineers).

Notably, **none of these people define the question**&mdash;that is, the $p \implies q$.

Instead, they’re employed by *leadership*&mdash;the ones who pose the question&mdash;who, very helpfully, went to business school, **where it seems they were taught that defining $p$ or $q$ is someone else’s job.**

# If shrimp, then towel

> What will our revenue be next year? 

Every day, analysts confidently present in boardrooms the results of data analysis,

> If shrimp, then towel&mdash;*with 97.2342% accuracy!*

wherein *shrimp* and *towel* stand for numbers that have *nothing* to do with the question posed and *no one knows* how far they've drifted from intention.

# Answering the right question

Logicians are developing ways to step back and ask, 

> Is our $p \implies q$ faithful in this complex system of people interoperating with tools?

A powerful way to do this is to construct an **olog**&mdash;

Douglas Adams had no idea how prescient he was.

So, to ensure we are not doing **if shrimp, then towel** data science, the question that matters is:
