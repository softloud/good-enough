Elizabeth Bishop's [*One Art*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art) is a [katabasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabasis) (a hero's descent into the underworld) tracing loss.

**One Art**  
*By Elizabeth Bishop*  

The art of losing isn’t hard to master;  
so many things seem filled with the intent  
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.  

Lose something every day. Accept the fluster  
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.  
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.  

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:  
places, and names, and where it was you meant  
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.  

I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or  
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.  
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.  

I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,  
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.  
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.  

—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture  
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident  
the art of losing’s not too hard to master  
though it may look like (*Write* it!) like disaster.
:::

In the final stanza, she takes an [Orphean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_and_Eurydice) turn to *write* that some loss is **categorically** different, no matter how much we may wish it were not.

Bishop descends through grief by way of categories of loss. The transitions between stanzas trace **functors**--structure-preserving maps that model how we experience loss similarly, until we don't: an Orphean turn that *writes* grief. 

## Categories of loss 

Formalising [categories of loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) reveals the exquisite ontology of grief Bishop unfolds, in which:

- **Objects** comprise the protagonist and things they have lost;
- **Morphisms** relate how the protagonist has lost comparable things;
- **Functors** relate entire categories of loss, preserving structure--until they don't.

## From everyday loss to experiential loss

Bishop first traces how the things we say we 'lose', such as *keys* and *hours*, is similar to the way we forget *places* we've been and *names* of people we've met. 

These losses *are no disaster*.

Losing her mother's watch is a shame--but in the grand scheme of things, it is not **categorically** worse than losing memories once treasured: places and names forgotten. 

To lose that which *represents*--a metonym--is still *no disaster*.

## To the loss almost too hard to write

:::

Bishop has almost convinced us that loss is *not too hard to master*--as one can tolerate losing a continent. 

But she turns, like Orpheus, in her katabasis of grief to *write* that here **the diagram fails to commute**; for losing a beloved feels *like disaster*.
