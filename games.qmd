# Good Enough Game Development ðŸŽ®

## ðŸš€ Mathematically-Driven Narrative & AI Systems  

Game development is more than just visuals and mechanicsâ€”it's about **formal structures, logic, and decision trees** that create **immersive, dynamic experiences**.  
At **Good Enough Data & Systems Lab**, I use **finite state machines (FSMs), procedural generation, and mathematical logic** to craft intelligent, replayable, and **provably correct** game systems.

## ðŸŽ­ Finite State Machines in Narrative Design  

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a formal model that defines **game logic as a directed graph**. Each game state (node) is connected by **decision-based edges**, leading to structured yet flexible storytelling.  

In my work, I encode **FSM-driven narratives** in a way that makes paths explicit, modular, and scalable.  
Hereâ€™s an example of how an FSM is implemented in **R**, defining game states and transitions:

```r
# Define the FSM as a graph structure
library(tidygraph)

game_fsm <- tribble(
  ~from, ~to, ~decision,
  "start", "explore", "choose to explore",
  "start", "wait", "choose to wait",
  "explore", "find_item", "discover an artifact",
  "explore", "danger", "encounter a threat",
  "find_item", "win", "artifact is key to success",
  "danger", "lose", "failed to escape danger"
) %>% as_tbl_graph()

# Visualizing the FSM with ggraph
library(ggraph)
ggraph(game_fsm, layout = "tree") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(label = decision), arrow = arrow()) +
  geom_node_label(aes(label = name), fill = "lightblue") +
  theme_minimal()
