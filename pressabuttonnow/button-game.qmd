# living analysis development lifecycle graph

## vertices

Let $v \in V$ be a vertex $v$ in a set of vertices $V$, where each vertex is a step in living analysis development.

## edges

Let $e = (v_\text{from}, \psi(v_\text{from})) = (v_\text{from}, v_\text{to})$ be an edge $E$ from a set of edges $E = V \times \Psi = V \times V$, representing a transition from one step of living analysis development to another where $\Psi : V \mapsto V$ determined casewise by $v_\text{from}$ in $e$.

## determine path relation

### cover node

This function sets the next edge-relation in the path $P \subset V \times V$.

### player choice
