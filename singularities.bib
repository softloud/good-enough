	abstract = {Anxiety disorders are some of the most widespread mental health issues worldwide. In educational settings, individuals may suffer from specific forms of test and performance anxiety that are connected to a knowledge domain. Unquestionably, the most prominent of these is math anxiety. Math anxiety is a widespread problem for all ages across the globe. In the international assessments of the Programme for International Student Assessment ({PISA}) studies, a majority of adolescents report worry and tension in math classes and when doing math. To understand how math anxiety takes effect, it has to be regarded as a variable within an ensemble of interacting variables. There are antecedents that facilitate the development of math anxiety. They concern environmental factors such as teachers’ and parents’ attitudes toward their students’ and children’s ability in math, societal stereotypes (eg, on females’ math abilities), or personal factors such as traits or gender. These antecedents influence a number of variables that are important in learning processes. Math anxiety interacts with variables such as self-efficacy or motivation in math, which can intensify or counteract math anxiety. Outcomes of math anxiety concern not only performance in math-related situations, they can also have long-term effects that involve efficient (or not-so-efficient) learning as well as course and even vocational choices. How can math anxiety be counteracted? A first step lies in its correct diagnosis. Questionnaires for the assessment of math anxiety exist for all age groups, starting at primary education level. Help against math anxiety can be offered on different levels: by educational institutions, by teachers and a change in instructional approaches, by parents, or by the affected person. However, much more research is needed to develop effective measures against math anxiety that are tailored to an individual’s characteristics and needs.},

With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asmiov's trademark. "From the Hardcover edition."},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/4cbuv},
	abstract = {The idea that human cognition is, or can be understood as, a form of computation is a useful conceptual tool for cognitive science. It was a foundational assumption during the birth of cognitive science as a multidisciplinary field, with Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) as one of its contributing fields. One conception of {AI} in this context is as a provider of computational tools (frameworks, concepts, formalisms, models, proofs, simulations, etc.) that support theory building in cognitive science. The contemporary field of {AI}, however, has taken the theoretical possibility of explaining human cognition as a form of computation to imply the practical feasibility of realising human(-like or -level) cognition in factual computational systems; and, the field frames this realisation as a short-term inevitability. Yet, as we formally prove herein, creating systems with human(-like or -level) cognition is intrinsically computationally intractable. This means that any factual {AI} systems created in the short-run are at best decoys. When we think these systems capture something deep about ourselves and our thinking, we induce distorted and impoverished images of ourselves and our cognition. In other words, {AI} in current practice is deteriorating our theoretical understanding of cognition rather than advancing and enhancing it. The situation could be remediated by releasing the grip of the currently dominant view on {AI} and by returning to the idea of {AI} as a theoretical tool for cognitive science. In reclaiming this older idea of {AI}, however, it is important not to repeat conceptual mistakes of the past (and present) that brought us to where we are today.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual mathematical framework for developing rich human–machine interactions in order to improve decision-making in a social organisation, S. The idea is to model how S can create a “multi-level artificial cognitive system”, called a data analyser ({DA}), to collaborate with humans in collecting and learning how to analyse data, to anticipate situations, and to develop new responses, thus improving decision-making. In this model, the {DA} is “processed” to not only gather data and extend existing knowledge, but also to learn how to act autonomously with its own specific procedures or even to create new ones. An application is given in cases where such rich human–machine interactions are expected to allow the {DA}+S partnership to acquire deep anticipation capabilities for possible future changes, e.g., to prevent risks or seize opportunities. The way the social organization S operates over time, including the construction of {DA}, is described using the conceptual framework comprising “memory evolutive systems” ({MES}), a mathematical theoretical approach introduced by Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch for evolutionary multi-scale, multi-agent and multi-temporality systems. This leads to the definition of a “data analyser–{MES}”.},

	abstract = {Category theory is a general theory of mathematical structures and their relations. It was introduced by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in the middle of the 20th century in their foundational work on algebraic topology. Category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics. In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.
Many areas of computer science also rely on category theory, such as functional programming and semantics.
A category is formed by two sorts of objects: the objects of the category, and the morphisms, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism. Metaphorically, a morphism is an arrow that maps its source to its target. Morphisms can be composed if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one. Morphism composition has similar properties as function composition (associativity and existence of an identity morphism for each object). Morphisms are often some sort of functions, but this is not always the case. For example, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object, whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid.
The second fundamental concept of category theory is the concept of a functor, which plays the role of a morphism between two categories

	shorttitle = {To be {FAIR}},
	abstract = {Innovations in open science and meta-science have focused on rigorous *theory testing*,
yet methods for specifying, sharing, and iteratively improving theories remain underdeveloped.
To address these limitations, we introduce *{FAIR} theory*:
A standard for specifying theories as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable information artifacts.
{FAIR} theories are Findable in well-established archives,
Accessible in practical terms and in terms of their ability to be understood,
Interoperable for specific purposes, e.g., to guide control variable selection,
and
Reusable so that they can be iteratively improved through collaborative efforts.
This paper adapts the {FAIR} principles for theory,
reflects on the {FAIRness} of contemporary theoretical practices in psychology,
introduces a workflow for {FAIRifying} theory,
and explores {FAIR} theories’ potential impact in terms of reducing research waste,
enabling meta-research on the structure and development of theories,
and incorporating theory into reproducible research workflows – from hypothesis generation to simulation studies.
We make use of well-established open science infrastructure, including
Git for version control, {GitHub} for collaboration, and Zenodo for archival and search indexing.
By applying the principles and infrastructure that have already revolutionized sharing of data and publications to theory, 
we establish a sustainable, transparent, and collaborative approach to theory development.
{FAIR} theory equips scholars with a standard for systematically specifying and refining theories, bridging a critical gap in open research practices and supporting the renewed interest in theory development in psychology and beyond.
{FAIR} theory provides a structured, cumulative framework for theory development, increasing efficiency and potentially accelerating the pace of cumulative knowledge acquisition},

	abstract = {Discrete dynamical systems are commonly used to model the spread of contagions on real-world networks. Under the {PAC} framework, existing research has studied the problem of learning the behavior of a system, assuming that the underlying network is known. In this work, we focus on a more challenging setting: to learn both the behavior and the underlying topology of a black-box system. We show that, in general, this learning problem is computationally intractable. On the positive side, we present efficient learning methods under the {PAC} model when the underlying graph of the dynamical system belongs to some classes. Further, we examine a relaxed setting where the topology of an unknown system is partially observed. For this case, we develop an efficient {PAC} learner to infer the system and establish the sample complexity. Lastly, we present a formal analysis of the expressive power of the hypothesis class of dynamical systems where both the topology and behavior are unknown, using the well-known formalism of the Natarajan dimension. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for learning both the behavior and topology of discrete dynamical systems.},

An early presentation of concept analysis gives both a concrete foundation for the subsequent theory of complete lattices and a glimpse of a methodology for data analysis that is of commercial value in social science. Classroom experience has led to numerous pedagogical improvements and many new exercises have been added. As before, exposure to elementary abstract algebra and the notation of set theory are the only prerequisites, making the book suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.

More remarkably, it manages to do so without discarding a commitment to mathematical substance and rigour.

data sharing with privacy rights and ethical and regulatory requirements,
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable ({FAIR}) metadata should be
developed. According to the H2020 Program Guidelines on {FAIR} Data, data should
be “as open as possible and as closed as necessary”,
“open” in order to foster the reusability and to accelerate
research, but at the same time they should be “closed” to
safeguard the privacy of the subjects. Additional provisions on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data have been
endorsed by the European General Data Protection Regulation ({GDPR}), Reg ({EU})
2016/679, that came into force in May 2018. This work aims to solve
accessibility problems related to the protection of personal data in the digital
era and to achieve a responsible access to and responsible use of health data.
We strongly suggest associating each data set with {FAIR} metadata describing both
the type of data collected and the accessibility conditions by considering data
protection obligations and ethical and regulatory requirements. Finally, an
existing {FAIR} infrastructure component has been used as an example to explain
how {FAIR} metadata could facilitate data sharing while ensuring protection of
individuals.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, particularly in set theory, the aleph numbers are a sequence of numbers used to represent the cardinality (or size) of infinite sets. They were introduced by the mathematician Georg Cantor and are named after the symbol he used to denote them, the Hebrew letter aleph (ℵ).
The smallest cardinality of an infinite set is that of the natural numbers, denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}aleph \_\{0\}\}
  
 (read aleph-nought, aleph-zero, or aleph-null); the next larger cardinality of a well-ordered set is 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            1
          
        
        ,
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}aleph \_\{1\},\}
  
 then 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}aleph \_\{2\}\}
  
 and so on. Continuing in this manner, it is possible to define an infinite cardinal number 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}aleph \_\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\}
  
 for every ordinal number 
  
    
      
        α
        ,
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}alpha ,\}
  
 as described below.
The concept and notation are due to Georg Cantor,
who defined the notion of cardinality and realized that infinite sets can have different cardinalities.
The aleph numbers differ from the infinity (
  
    
      
        ∞
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}infty \}
  
) commonly found in algebra and calculus, in that the alephs measure the sizes of sets, while infinity is commonly defined either as an extreme limit of the real number line (applied to a function or sequence that "diverges to infinity" or "increases without bound"), or as an extreme point of the extended real number line.},

	abstract = {Plato's allegory of the cave is an allegory presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work Republic (514a–520a, Book {VII}) to compare "the effect of education (παιδεία) and the lack of it on our nature". It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates and is narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the Sun (508b–509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509d–511e).
In the allegory, Plato describes people who have spent their entire lives chained by their necks and ankles in front of an inner wall with a view of the empty outer wall of the cave. They observe the shadows projected onto the outer wall by objects carried behind the inner wall by people who are invisible to the chained “prisoners” and who walk along the inner wall with a fire behind them, creating the shadows on the inner wall in front of the prisoners. The "sign bearers" pronounce the names of the objects, the sounds of which are reflected near the shadows and are understood by the prisoners as if they were coming from the shadows themselves.
Only the shadows and sounds are the prisoners' reality, which are not accurate representations of the real world. The shadows represent distorted and blurred copies of reality we can perceive through our senses, while the objects under the Sun represent the true forms of objects that we can only perceive through reason. Three higher levels exist: natural science; deductive mathematics, geometry, and logic; and the theory of forms.
Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not the direct source of the images seen. A philosopher aims to understand and perceive the higher levels of reality. However, the other inmates of the cave do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life.
Socrates remarks that this allegory can be paired with previous writings, namely the analogy of the Sun and the analogy of the divided line.},

If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.Deep Work is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.'Cal Newport is exceptional in the realm of self-help authors' New York Times'Deep work' is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. Coined by author and professor Cal Newport on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you better at what you do, let you achieve more in less time and provide the sense of true fulfilment that comes from the mastery of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive economy.And yet most people, whether knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creatives struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and social media, not even realising there's a better way.A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. Put simply: developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions you can make in an increasingly distracted world. This book will point the way.},
