## Systemic Injustice in Conservation

Dr Gray and Dr Gupta drive conservation justice research partnerships. This provides a sandbox for the Good Enough Lab to develop methodologies, creating a virtuous cycle between research for social good and the tech industry.

In development, we have the give a dam project. This involves analysis of survey data. 

In this case, the obstacle is extraction of semantic attributes, that is, things we know about respondents in the survey.

Am now building the DBT-dagstar pipeline from [this .Rmd proof of concept](https://github.com/softloud/gg/blob/main/README.md).

Questionable Analytical Observations — on bad data and what to do about it — and Structured Intelligence Governance, a call to formalise the musical score of ensemble algorithms, are both well underway. The text is largely complete; I’m now building production-grade visualisation tools to support their arguments.

The Lab's methodologies are fundamentally shaped by Dr Charles T. Gray's scientific research. 

Dr Gray began working in systems epistemology in 2012, what she does for a living has been rebranded several times in tech hype cycles.

- big data
- informatics
- data science
- machine learning
- artificial intelligence

Charles calls all this:

> math, data, and code.

### Dr Gray's doctoral thesis on data science governance

→ [Towards a Measure of code::proof: A toolchain walkthrough for computationally developing a statistical estimator](https://opal.latrobe.edu.au/articles/thesis/Towards_a_Measure_of_code_proof_A_toolchain_walkthrough_for_computationally_developing_a_statistical_estimator/14099561/1?file=26590526)

The Good Enough Lab is heavily influenced by Charles' research in systems epistemology; how can we **trust** the math, data, and code are answering the question we intended?


### Math

The Good Enough Lab draws on Dr Gray's training in abstract algebra and mathematical chaos.

## Data simulation, visualisation, and scientific computing

### Code

It's not enough for me to theorise, I always need to instantiate.

- [simeta](https://softloud.github.io/simeta/) for simulating  meta-analysis data
- [varameta](https://github.com/softloud/varameta#varameta) for estimating the variance of the sample median
- [parameterpal](https://softloud.github.io/parameterpal/) for interpretable beta distribution parameters
- [pcheck](https://github.com/softloud/pcheck) shiny app for exploring possible p-values 
- [panda](https://github.com/softloud/panda#panda) visualising pandas as scatter plots
- [good enough site source](https://github.com/softloud/good-enough) this website is made using quarto
- [digmus](https://github.com/softloud/digmus#digmus) for animating a melody as a graph object (useR Group Copenhagen)
- [dbt career lineage](https://github.com/softloud/dbt_career_lineage) a dbt pipeline that shows my career as a dbt graph (DBT Meetup Copenhagen)
- [supermetroid](https://softloud.github.io/supermetroid/) analysis of open video game player data (PyData Copenhagen)
- [retention](https://softloud.github.io/retention/) simulate gameplay data to explore good enough analytics for video games
