## Systemic Injustice in Conservation

Dr Gray and Dr Gupta drive conservation justice research partnerships. This provides a sandbox for the Good Enough Lab to develop methodologies, creating a virtuous cycle between research for social good and the tech industry.

The Lab's methodologies are fundamentally shaped by Dr Charles T. Gray's scientific research. 

Dr Gray began working in systems epistemology in 2012, what she does for a living has been rebranded several times in tech hype cycles.

- big data
- informatics
- data science
- machine learning
- artificial intelligence

Charles calls all this:

> math, data, and code.

### Dr Gray's doctoral thesis on data science governance

→ [Towards a Measure of code::proof: A toolchain walkthrough for computationally developing a statistical estimator](https://opal.latrobe.edu.au/articles/thesis/Towards_a_Measure_of_code_proof_A_toolchain_walkthrough_for_computationally_developing_a_statistical_estimator/14099561/1?file=26590526)

The Good Enough Lab is heavily influenced by Charles' research in systems epistemology; how can we **trust** the math, data, and code are answering the question we intended?

### Math

The Good Enough Lab draws on Dr Gray's training in abstract algebra and mathematical chaos.
