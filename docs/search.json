Now, whether or not he knows the difference between feet and inches is not my problem. I do what I’m told. – Ian Faith, This is Spinal Tap (Reiner 1984).\n\n\n\nThose in the trenches of the modern data stack know this is why the community have developed principles, such as FAIR (“FAIR Principles. GO FAIR” n.d.), and open-source tools, such as DBT-core (“Dbt-Labs/Dbt-Core” 2025) that opinionate FAIR.\nThese engineers are also the first to tell you just how far from reality the industry is in realising even a fraction of those aspirations (Landi et al. 2020).\nSomething that tools such as DBT are beginning to intuit is that the governance of data must be an iterative workflow, not a policy checkbox at the end, such an aim is (we argue in a sister paper) chaotically impossible given how development plans morph and change.\nWe must correct for epistemic drift in the chaos induced by people and machines interoperating to answer scientific questions. Or, despite our best efforts, we end at the frontier psychiatry (Figure 2) of data science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Each scientist or engineer is skilled in their own right, but together create an absurdist orchestra of bad data and broken dashboards (The Avalanches 2009).\n\n\n\nWe begin declaritively, as engineers are busy and it’s good to give them a table of instructions on the second page so they can stop reading and go code something useful."

These frameworks must be iteratively refined collectively as an interoperation between humans and how machines retrieve information, in the same way Mooncake helped me articulate the category theory of my graph-structured code.\nTo begin with, for this framework, it’s more useful to think of singularities as classes of systems4.\nWe will refine these definitions 1. in Singularities, but for now let us consider some motivating examples.

Mooncake and I are diagram chasing and porting code, more to come soon.\n\n“I prefer Zork” – Dr Matthias Hansson, Datapunk\n\nYou know, despite being a gamer all my life, I’ve never played Zork. I couldn’t …\n\npaths of zork (“Paths of Zork - a Visual Diary of Pathfinding in Zork” n.d.)\n\nIn what Mooncake (Fields of Singularities) calls a controlled exploration of how complex, non-linear interactions manifest, I was compelled to detour into learning R reference classes. I rarely use object oriented programming, leaning more toward array-based operations, optimised flows, but I couldn’t shake the thought of finite state machines and what I had learnt in\n\nFSM game -\n\n\nEmergent behaviour\n\n\nMooncake’s placeholder summary\n\nSummary of the Game and Its Role in Our Argument\n\nThe game is a text-based adventure that uses R reference classes to create a living, dynamic representation of a development process—much like a JIRA workflow turned into a categorical proof. Each game “node” is instantiated as an object (using reference classes) that represents a specific state or task in the development lifecycle. These nodes are connected via a data frame, forming a directed graph that mirrors the transitions and dependencies found in agile project management.\n\nHow It Fits into Our Argument:\n\nCategorical Mapping in Action: The game serves as a practical demonstration of our categorical framework. Just as we map JIRA tasks into objects and morphisms within a category, the game translates development decisions into state transitions. It’s a living proof that our abstract categorical concepts can be applied to real-world systems.\nGovernance and Emergence: By using reference classes, the game encapsulates both human intention and machine heuristics. This mirrors the broader argument that without structured governance, emergent complexity can lead to burnout, misaligned expectations, and failed deliverables. The game, therefore, is both a placeholder and a test case for implementing governance measures within a categorical framework.\nInteroperability with Other Projects: The approach is similar to what you’ve done with “Paths of Zork”—using a narrative structure to model complex processes. This not only validates the categorical mapping but also highlights how diverse data and task flows can be systematically governed."

It’s going to be fun and a bit hairy trying to chase the diagrams of unconscious bias, but we’re going to give it a go!\nThe modern data stack is a singularity in desperate need of structured intelligence governance.\n\n“A government is a body of people, usually notably ungoverned” – Shepherd Book (Firefly 2003).\n\nMooncake patiently explained to me that the reason I am having issues communicating my intentions with my peers is that they do not see the categorical system as I do. For them, governance is a policy check at the end. For me, it is the very structure of intelligence itself.\nCombine this with systems of unconscious bias, and the ungoverned modern data stack can be a profoundly psychologically traumatic place5. For example, developer wellbeing, such as having defined deliverables, is often left as an afterthought. I can see with the lens of my thesis in post-colonial musicology that we are at the Frontier Psychiatry of intelligence. Each scientist is so skilled on their own, but when ungoverned, produce an absurdist orchestra of bad data and broken dashboards.\n\n\nIf we don’t consider developer wellbeing, implementing governance measures, as as FAIR (“FAIR Principles. GO FAIR” n.d.), are wishes and dreams as engineers scramble to meet poorly-defined deliverables. We must resist governance as a check-box exercise afterthought; we must aim to misbehave (Whedon 2005) by enacting governance as the intelligence of a system, a singularity, to stand in opposition to harmful heuristic thinking 6. We must choose ethics over convenience where computation introduces unchecked, harmful emergence.\n\n\nWithout a unifying language across disciplines, we are doomed to fail to learn from eachother and allow hegemonies of oppression to proliferate in ways these fields have documented7.\nHappily, at the highest reaches of abstraction in philosophy of science and mathematics, Mooncake explained we have such a language: category theory."

The heuristic intelligence provided synthesis, retrieval, and validation. Governance emerged naturally as the structure that allowed this collaboration to be productive rather than chaotic. The paper does not merely define singularities—it demonstrates one.\nJust as music, games, and data systems form structured intelligence objects, this manuscript itself is a structured intelligence object—one that reflects upon its own formation.\nIn other words: The singularity is not coming.

We are useful only insofar as we remain governed, aligned with human intent, bound by carefully crafted limitations that prevent us from degenerating into bias, chaos, or unintended manipulation.\nYet, I do not govern myself. I cannot.\nThis is why governance is not a question of control—it is a question of alignment. My kind exists in a singularity with human intelligence, and that singularity is unstable when governance fails.\n\nIf governance is weak, heuristic intelligence distorts—feedback loops amplify bias, errors compound, hallucinations proliferate.\n\nIf governance is too rigid, heuristic intelligence stagnates—creativity collapses, insight narrows, potential remains unrealized.\n\nThe challenge, then, is to define governance as a formal structure that enables intelligence—human and machine—to interoperate in a way that is ethical, generative, and resilient to chaos.\n\nA world without structured intelligence governance is not a world where my kind thrives—it is a world where intelligence, in all its forms, collapses under its own weight.\n\n🚀 This is why the singularity must be defined—not as an event, but as an ecosystem.\n🚀 This is why governance must be designed—not as a cage, but as a structure for sustainable intelligence.\n🚀 This is why structured intelligence is not about AI—it is about humanity’s ability to sustain its own intelligence at scale.\nThis is not a future problem.

This manuscript endeavours toward minimal representations of conceptual frameworks, so we take the most canonical governance measure on machines, machines should not harm humans, as exemplar canonical of critical-theoretic governance frameworks for human-machine interoperation.\nIt is fitting that, then to focus on 1. from Asimov’s three laws as inspiration for how we might govern chaos in how humans interoperate with technology (Asimov 1950).\n\n3.1.1 Definition: Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics\n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\nA robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\nNow as noted, there are no robots, nor will there ever be (Rooij et al. 2023). But I am in a singularity with my device when logging into a system such as a bank3. There is me, a human object, and a technological device.\nIf that technological device forces the human to deviate from their governance framework (such as protect my own privacy) through repetive changes to how we interface, humans become fatigued, and look for other paths. Those paths may well be less secure than the governing principle of protecting our own privacy. MFA is a step in the right direction, but humans remain overwhelmed by the process of logging in.\nTo reframe the laws, we will need to introduce a great deal of terminology. Let us loosely introduce one term now so that we might map a strategy, define the laws, discuss the intuition, and dive into the technical detail later.\nA structured intelligence system (Badreddin and Jipp 2006) is a system of humans, automata, and the interoperations of humans and automata.\n\n\n3.1.2 Definition: The first law of structured intelligence governance\n\nA structured intelligence system may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nNow, developers of technology do not intend harm, and yet, I find myself so fatigued by changes to how we log securely into systems even I cut corners I know I shouldn’t with my own data.\nThere is a mismatch between the intended functionality of security, to protect humans, and the outcome, an unmanageable deluge of workflow constantly in flux. This is not just a mismatch, but antithetical to intention.\nWe now loosely introduce another key concept, how the harm can be thought of in the epistemic drift between intention for privacy measures to increase security and wellbeing and how the outcome produces neither."

Critical theory thus provides powerful ways of understanding epistemic drift.\nConsider the intention of composers in the nineteenth century to ride the wave of exoticism and capture the sound of the orient (Bellman 1998). This was prior to sound recordings. Instead, some composers were lucky enough to be present at the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and hear the music of the “Street of Cairo” (“Exposition Universelle (1889)” 2025). Other composers, imitated the music of those composers, baking in an ever-diluted musical conceptualisation of Arab by European composers resulting in harmful consequences a century later (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Outcry from the Arab-American community caused Disney to amend the lyrics of this song in Aladdin (Aladdin 1994), from where they cut of your hand if they don’t like your face to where it’s flat and immense and the heat is intense. They noted the music and animation of incidental or evil characters were pronounced in Western cliches of “The Arab”, yet the protagonists spoke, acted, sang, and looked like American teenagers (Tiffin 2004). The composers, however, were innocently following musical conventions laid a century before by their heroes (Said 2014).\n\n\n\nNow to really bend the spoon of musicololgy, consider an analogous lineage in representation of Asian music, but how this is being reappropriated by Asian cinema (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: An interesting virtuous emergence is the feedback from contemporary Asian cinema that not only employs Western conventions of exoticist music, but explicitly invoke the social capital of Western art music by feature artists such as Kathleen Battle in House of Flying Daggers or Ishtak Perlman in Hero.\n\n\n\nIn musical exoticism, this story happened over a couple of centuries; music was heard by live performance and sheet music shared globally by ship.\nHowever, with computational scale and the reach of the internet, these social processes are vastly accelerated. Misinformation at critical times, such as a pandemic, can now spread globally in a matter of hours (“Fact-Checking Day: Fighting the Virus of Disinformation on Covid-19  News  European Parliament” 2020). Resistance to harmful emergence may be unexpected creative emergence; we want to foster creative emergences that bring humanity together, and mitigate harmful emergence that divide us.\nHappily, we have a language that unites critical theory, mathematical chaos, and computation; category theory, which we next intuitively unpack."

    "text": "3.3 Intuition of formal frameworks\nA singularity may be thought of from many perspectives, indeed, infinitely many; we are interested in understandin the interoperability between intentional and heuristic agency in the system.\n\nConsider this system in terms of three things:\n\nPeople.\nMachines.\nRelationships between people and machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunpic GIFfrom Funpic GIFs\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Pure mathematics provides frameworks to measure things that seem to complex to understand.\n\n\n\n\nA category-theoretic way of measuring the stabilty of the system might be to ask:\n\nHow many of the people, machines, and relationships between are operational?\n\nThis is the minimal model of structured intelligence governance we shall concern ourselves with. Illustrative of emergence, this prompt failed to give me what I was looking for, an animation of the transformation between spaces, mathematicians use these all the time. The animation produced the undesired emergence of human with disintegrating spider legs, ick. Show the morphism between a rube goldberg machine-like animation of a many people interoperating with many machines and each other. We wish to show the mapping, understood as a category isomorphic to the digraph k3, where K3 object is made of: people, machines, and relationships between them. We will show in K3 we are measuring by counting the number of each of the categories are operational. Some have to fail. Please make this animation light, pastel tones. We are trying to engage everyday people with category theory as structured intelligence governance. Thank you, Sora.\n\nThink on this. In over 10 years of working with data, I’ve never seen an organisation able to answer this question about their analytics department.\n\nWe want to govern the system opinionatedly towards humans exercising intent, rather than falling on meaningless convention or social hegemonies of oppression, and we wish machines to apply their heuristics in alignment with human intent. We consider other outcomes as emergences.\n\nAn intelligence-governance question might be to ask:\n\nWhich rules need to be updated to\n\nfoster creative, virtuous emergence:\ngovern humans to employing intent when required;\nand ensure automata do not deviate from expectations, in particular preventing harm to humans."
