    "text": "2.3 Data is knowledge, knowledge is power\n\nA government is a body of people, usually, notably ungoverned. –Shepherd Book ([10])\n\nThe intelligence of a structured intelligence system is only as good as the human’s ability to interoperate within the singularity. If knowledge is power, then human empowerment suffers epistemic injustice, injustice related to knowledge, when data systems fail to provide the knowledge a human needs reliably. Data development is implemented by humans, usually, notably ungoverned.\nWe think structured intelligence governance falls more in the subcategory of epistemological injustice within the theories of epistemic injustice, however there are aspects of systems epistemology that also fall into testimonial or hermeneutical injustice [11]. However, it’s not for us to say, for we are not experts in epistemic injustice.\nWe will need the help of those theorists in examining epistemic injustice of inaccess to data. For example, standard information technology procedures, such as the principle of least privilege [12], wherein access is granted on a needs basis, can create barriers to data when the stakeholder does not know which data to request.\nOur intention is to build bridges from the world of data science system design to people who understand how to write better rules for structured intelligence systems.\n\n2.3.1 Making data FAIR\nOne—just one!—way of examining epistemic injustice in data systems is to ask if the system is findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) for domain-knowledge analysts who design questions and answers [13].\n\n\n\nTable 1: Loosest interpretation of FAIR has been employed for this manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAIR principle\nMinimal interpretation\n\n\n\n\nFindable\nPerson can find the analysis from their machine in a way that makes sense to them.\n\n\nAccessible\nPerson can interpret what they see in a way that makes sense to them.\n\n\nInteroperable\nPerson can manipulate the analysis in ways specific to their role.\n\n\nReusable\nPerson can reuse analysis components for future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe propose, as for example, that a visual guide for surfacing what is jointly understood in terms of domain-specific variables that are:\n\nwithin the data and\n\nare of interest to the domain knowledge questioners.\n\nThis structured intelligence system must be FAIR to each human within the system. We propose clopen analytics (Definition 5), in opposition to the principle of least privilege, wherein access is granted on a justified needs basis [12].\nWhen the technology itself is a barrier to knowledge, we must question if its application achieves the outcome intended.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT generated from script\n\n\n\nIf the principle of least privilege applies, then the default is epistemic exclusion—a structurally encoded barrier to intentional access.\n\n\nDefinition 5 Clopen analytics.\n\nFAIR SIS\nClopen analytics is an approach to living analysis development SIS that prioritises making the following artifacts FAIR to each human in the SIS:\n\nProject intention;\nData;\nAnalyses.\n\nContextual to human\nFAIR is contextual to each human’s requirements for interoperating in the SIS.\nClopen\nThe SIS is secure and closed to those who do not require access to this SIS; for humans within the SIS, open-source community frameworks apply.\n\n\n\nWithout a shared understanding of the domain-specific variables and other FAIR principles met for each member of the team, those with the most at stake are largely locked out. Team members with the domain-specific questions to answer cannot guide the analysis through inquiry, and data developers are confused by constantly-changing requirements.\nFurthermore, we need to standardise knowledge-transfer methodologies so that computational instances may follow critical-theoretic frameworks designed to prevent epistemic injustice."

We do not try to reach beyond what might be covered in the first seminar of any postgraduate field. We admire the spirit of Category Theory for the Sciences (we are studying chapter 2) that formalises not for intellectual flourish, but to explain universalities across contexts, cutting across semantic reinvention of each other’s wheels [1].\nWe build systems for people to interoperate with each other in what feels like a dark room; by formalising our computation we hope to expose plug-and-play interoperabilities with those who can help us write just rules into the systems that govern our lives—humanity must learn to bend the spoon together to govern the chaos of the singularities we live in."

    "text": "3.1 Why math and Asimov matter more than ever\nCritical theory is now coinciding with category theory in philosophy [14], allowing for a rich formal framework to apply constraints defined by scholars who have studied the harms of humans blindly defaulting to heuristic social norms in race [15], gender [16], and class [17]2. This manuscript endeavours toward minimal representations of conceptual frameworks, so we take the most canonical governance measure on machines, systems should not harm humans, as exemplar canonical of critical-theoretic governance frameworks for human-machine interoperation.\nIt is fitting that, then to focus on 1. from Asimov’s three laws (Definition 6) as inspiration for how we might govern chaos in how humans interoperate with technology [18].\n\n\nDefinition 6 Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics\n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\nA robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Structured intelligence governance\nNow as noted, there are no robots, nor will there ever be [4]. But I am in a singularity with my device when logging into a system such as a bank3. There is me, a human object, and a technological device.\n\n3.1.1.1 Codifying the rules of singularities\nIf that technological device forces the human to deviate from their governance framework (such as protect my own privacy) through repetive changes to how we interface, humans become fatigued, and look for other paths. Those paths may well be less secure than the governing principle of protecting our own privacy. MFA is a step in the right direction, but humans remain overwhelmed by the process of logging in.\nTo diagnose what is unjust about the system, we first need to agree upon what the system is.\n\n\nDefinition 7 Structured intelligence system\nA structured intelligence system comprises:\n\nhumans\nautomata\nheuristics, rules by which humans and automata interoperate\nhuman-generated intentions to be facilitated by heuristics\nemergences which may cause harm or unexpected good.\n\n\n\nWe are concerned with unintended emergences that render structured intelligence systems harmful.\n\n\nDefinition 8 Singularity\nA singularity represents a structured intelligence system of humans and automata that interoperate by heuristic and intentional relationships in which complexity of interoperation produces unexpected emergence.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Structured intelligence systems\nA structured intelligence system [8] is a system of humans, automata, and the interoperations of humans and automata.\n\n\nDefinition 9 The first law of structured intelligence governance\n\nA structured intelligence system must not unFAIRly provide analyses to humans in its singularity, where FAIRness is defined contextually for each role humans might interoperate as within the singularity.\n\n\n\nNow, developers of technology do not intend harm, and yet, I find myself so fatigued by changes to how we log securely into systems even I cut corners I know I shouldn’t with my own data.\nThere is a mismatch between the intended functionality of security, to protect humans, and the outcome, an unmanageable deluge of workflow constantly in flux. This is not just a mismatch, but antithetical to intention.\nWe now loosely introduce another key concept, how the harm can be thought of in the epistemic drift between intention for privacy measures to increase security and wellbeing and how the outcome produces neither."

    "text": "3.2 Epistemic drift in musical orientalism\nAsimov is a canonical example—a Google Scholar search for asimov's laws in literary theory yielded 17,200 results—within literary theory pointing to an ocean of knowledge we not interoperating with. We genre-switch for this section to critical-theoretic framing to explain the concept of epistemic drift.\nPostmodern frameworks provide theorists with a way of differentiating between a thing and its representation, notably which must be constructed by humans describing the thing. Any representation necessarily loses information, mathematically we would say a representation is a projection. Critical theory thus provides powerful ways of understanding epistemic drift.\nConsider the intention of composers in the nineteenth century to ride the wave of exoticism and capture the sound of the orient [19]. This was prior to sound recordings. Instead, some composers were lucky enough to be present at the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and hear the music of the “Street of Cairo” [20]. Other composers, imitated the music of those composers, baking in an ever-diluted musical conceptualisation of Arab by European composers resulting in harmful consequences a century later (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Outcry from the Arab-American community caused Disney to amend the lyrics of this song in Aladdin [21], from where they cut of your hand if they don’t like your face to where it’s flat and immense and the heat is intense. They noted the music and animation of incidental or evil characters were pronounced in Western cliches of “The Arab”, yet the protagonists spoke, acted, sang, and looked like American teenagers [22]. The composers, however, were innocently following musical conventions laid a century before by their heroes [15].\n\n\n\nNow to really bend the spoon of musicololgy, consider an analogous lineage in representation of Asian music, but how this is being reappropriated by Asian cinema (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: An interesting virtuous emergence is the feedback from contemporary Asian cinema that not only employs Western conventions of exoticist music, but explicitly invoke the social capital of Western art music by feature artists such as Kathleen Battle in House of Flying Daggers or Ishtak Perlman in Hero.\n\n\n\nIn musical exoticism, this story happened over a couple of centuries; music was heard by live performance and sheet music shared globally by ship.\nHowever, with computational scale and the reach of the internet, these social processes are vastly accelerated. Misinformation at critical times, such as a pandemic, can now spread globally in a matter of hours [23]. Resistance to harmful emergence may be unexpected creative emergence; we want to foster creative emergences that bring humanity together, and mitigate harmful emergence that divide us.\nHappily, we have a language that unites critical theory, mathematical chaos, and computation: category theory—there’s a reason Spivak named his canoncial text, Category Theory for the Sciences; it is a grammar across sciences.\nHere is our relational understanding of postcolonialism in graph form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8"

This process can be conceptualised as one enormous directed acyclic graph.\nThis singularity grows, always with a finite number of nodes and edges, but ever increasing in complexity and scale. So that it becomes impossible for humans to govern the logic of the transformations by eyeballing the code.\nWorse still, the entire team need to understand the XX desired, and that XX is subject to change as decisions are made about the desired YY during development.

Direct Products (P)\nWe verify that NLP-generated outputs satisfy these conditions:\n\n(H) Closure Under Homomorphisms\n✔ A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between algebras.\n✔ LLMs learn probabilistic mappings between token sequences, which is a homomorphism between free monoids (word sequences under concatenation).\n✔ If two LLMs are trained on similar corpora, there exists a mapping between their language models that preserves structure.\n✔ ✅ Thus, NLPs are closed under homomorphisms.\n\n\n(S) Closure Under Subalgebras\n✔ A subalgebra is a subset of an algebra that remains closed under its operations.\n✔ If we take any subset of an NLP’s token space, it still forms an induced probabilistic language model on that subspace.\n✔ Example: Training an LLM on a subset of language tokens (e.g., just medical or legal text) still results in a valid NLP model that follows the same algebraic rules.\n✔ ✅ Thus, NLPs are closed under subalgebras.\n\n\n(P) Closure Under Direct Products\n✔ If we take two NLP models and consider their direct product, we get a joint language model that can sample from both.\n✔ This is structurally identical to taking Cartesian products of free algebras, where the operations apply component-wise.\n✔ Example: A multilingual LLM trained separately on English and Hebrew can be combined into a joint probabilistic model spanning both.\n✔ ✅ Thus, NLPs are closed under direct products."

The request is mentioned briefly to the analyst, but never reaches the data engineer. The system remains unchanged.\nConsider game analytics. Player events are commonly instantiated by developers in a nested, tree-like structure, but analysts need flat data. At project start, the analyst verifies a key assumption: the minigame of interest appears only once per level. A dashboard is deployed using a modern stack—for example, Unity Analytics → Redshift → DBT → Redshift → Tableau.\nLater, developers add a second minigame to one of the levels and encode it differently in the tree, unaware that game designers are relying on the dashboard to track average minigame completion time. The analyst, unaware of the schema change, had averaged a nested field assuming uniqueness. That assumption no longer holds. One level now duplicates data, skewing the result. The data engineer doesn’t know it matters. The dashboard updates. It looks fine.\nBut the numbers are now meaningless–Unity Analytics ↛\\not \\to Tableau. The data is still valid, the dashboard still functions, the relationship is no longer valid.\nNo one notices. No one can. The assumption has silently broken."

The dataset now spans billions of rows, far beyond what the engineer can feasibly inspect. The model being fit is a log-based model requiring strictly positive numeric input—an assumption that would be clear in real-world biological data, but is easy to violate in simulation.\nSuppose a single mistake is introduced into the simulated data—negative values that breach the model’s assumptions. That error propagates silently, replicated thousands of times across model fits. Eventually, the pipeline breaks.

Think of them as directed graphs of people and things, which might be tools, but they might be, say, tickets in a development plan. Might also be organisational values. Think of the arrows as a plurality of stories, a rashomon of arrows, told about people and things in the system that answers a question using data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurosawa’s Rashomon 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurosawa’s Rashomon explores subjectivity by telling the same story from multiple perspectives.\n\n\nNow we can ask questions about how the structured intelligence system “thinks” in the ways defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructured intelligence governance\n\n\n\nStructured intelligence governance is the methodology humans use to interpret and measure the trustworthiness of the answers provided by the structured intelligence system. This is how we know how intelligent a system is. Think of this in terms of category theory and mathematical chaos. To figure out how to govern, we need to formalise so we have a grammar of reasoning about how well the structured intelligence system thinks.\n\n\nStructured intelligence systems devoid of structured intelligence governance are mindless golems [4]. The good enough lab eschews the term “artificial intelligence” as profoundly misleading."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nYou can hear in 1940s musicals optimism about Roosevelt’s New Deal, however, a weariness from the Great Depression, and a mounting horror at WWII.↩︎\nIn almost fifteen years of being employed to answer questions using math, code, and data, I’ve never been able to have confidence in the answers to the questions due to isolation, chaotic development, and poor data. Found duplicates and missing data on all critical pipelines and this has never been addressed. You cannot implement “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence”—or whatever buzzword—until you sort out how to know if you can trust the answer.↩︎\nPeople work from agile plans. These directed graphs instantiate data lineage preorders, data entities are partial orders, instantiated by SQL, R, and Python. These mathematical structures are deployed via toolstacks (Snowflake, Grafana, Argo, Azure, AWS Redshift, Tableau, Power BI, Shiny, Dagstar, DBT, GitHub, …) of inputs and outputs written in various languages (yml, SQL, go, rust, python, R, bash, markdown, jinja, regex, …) commonly called the modern data stack. Critical theory is the study of defining erased arrows in society. Testing methodologies provide ways of observing if the system is matching the plain laid in graph-oriented views. Category theory provides methods of instantiating these as higher-dimensional summaries for pluralities of ontologies. Category theory provides a bridge to critical theory so that pluralities of ontologies are honoured. And of course there is statistical modelling and natural language processing, complex transformations in Python and R and so forth, a node or two in the structured intelligence system. Data science provides methods of comparing, by way of mathematical chaos, emergence, epistemic drift, between project plans, ethical intentions, and instantiations. Everything is hard, everyone is skilled, everyone matters. Structured intelligence governance is the craft of bending the singularity in humanity’s favour. We can work this out people. Bend the singularity in humanity’s favour[^2].↩︎\nWhere is the data industry at with this? Any modern data stack methodology is dismissed as FAIRy talk. Engineers trust tools, so it needs to be served to them in opinionated features in their chosen stack.↩︎\nThey’re trying to do category theory, ’bless ’em, however here’s what I know about mathematics. It’s just like piano. Once you get to university, you start meeting real performing jazz and classical musicians. You start playing with them. And how good we are at it really just depends on how much time we have invested in the practice of the craft. The propulsion of any talent fades fast, a booster, after that it’s just grit. I used to say to my piano students that there are three Ps—playing, performance, practice—and only one really makes you better technically, practice. Can you imagine what it feels like for me to ask a question in which a mathematician like David Spivak [7] is present? I fully grasp the difference between us, but I need to reach out to different communities to learn how implement structured intelligence governance. That means doing the study, myself, and asking questions about what to study.↩︎\nI’ve studied what Cal Newport calls deep work all my life [8]. I had very little talent at piano, but it was the greatest peace I knew in an oft-loud household as a child—no boosters required. By the time I was ten years old I wanted to get up at 6am, before the family, and do an hour of blessed scales in peace. My Transylvanian grandmother was a concert pianist, a Holocaust refugee in exile. My father told me she said she would not interfere in how we were raised except to insist we learn piano. A beautiful, loved, 1930s upright was delivered to our house when I was seven years old. The flowstate of Bach was so all consuming there was no existential pain, there was only beauty. And there was a pull to my European roots, why I read Anne Frank’s diary and watched Schindlers list. It’s such a dream to be living here in Denmark, just the other day I was sitting in a pub chatting to the lovely barfolk about the jazz festival and the Murikami my neighbour was reading, the bartender was doing music science. I fit in better here, it’s time to learn Danish.↩︎\nMathematicians are currently favouring depth in algorithmic logic with little engagement across disciplines. I think that’s going in the wrong direction. It behoves both critical and category theory to explain the basics of each other’s fields and learn to interoperate. Arrows over objects. And the arrows between categories of thinking are more important than arrows within them—including category theory.↩︎\nI have never seen more people, myself included, working more stupidly together in my life. It’s an absurdist orchestra of broken dashboards and misrepresented numbers.↩︎\nIn almost fifteen years of being employed to answer questions using math, code, and data, I’ve never been able to have confidence in the answers to the questions due to isolation, chaotic development, and poor data. Found duplicates and missing data on all critical pipelines and this has never been addressed. You cannot implement “machine learning” and “artificial intelligence”—or whatever buzzword—until you sort out how to know if you can trust the answer.↩︎\nAnd quite frankly people get pretty hostile fast. The pattern is psychologically breathtaking in its consistency, when people are confronted with systems epistemology, they balk at being a node in a system. This is where the literature of mankeeping and so forth can support technology leadership in creating a safe workplace that honours a plurality of technical expertise. There’s a reason tech is so male dominated, it doesn’t need to be like this.↩︎\nBut look, let’s not start me my newborn thoughts of categories of species counterpoint… Seven Sketches is really doing a number on me [fong?], the logo turtle in my mind says,↩︎"

    "text": "Systemic Injustice Research Partners\nAs the Good Enough Lab’s founding Systemic Injustice Research Partner, Garima Gupta’s advocacy for biodiversity conservation in the Global South has helped shape the Lab’s values and purpose.\nDr Garima Gupta is an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of biodiversity, Indigenous knowledge, and environmental justice. Her work explores how systemic and epistemic injustices shape conservation and sustainability in the Global South, with a focus on the Himalayan region. Drawing on both ecological and social science methods, she investigates community-led governance, plural knowledge systems, and reparative justice. Garima collaborates with the Good Enough Lab to co-develop inclusive, context-sensitive, and politically aware approaches to sustainability.\n\nLearn more about Dr Gupta’s research—UN SDG trade-offs with The Beacon Project.\n\n\n\nGarima and Charles collaborate with other conservationists for justice, such as our recent publications with Assistant Professor Maya Pasgaard from Aarhus University. Another influential collaborator is Questionable Research Practices expert Dr Hannah Fraser.\n→ Learn more about Dr Gupta and Dr Gray’s research partnership."

At this level, it’s more analogous to band practice, where you are also writing songs together. Still, there’s a chart, often on a grubby napkin or whatever, but there’s a chart. And there are those that drive the creative vision, compose, and those who come to play.\nAll agile-oriented project planning tools (e.g., JIRA, Clickup, Monday) have ways of saving views with filters. All have dashboard and summary views. There’s always a way of finding a map if you don’t fight the tool.\nBy formalising these projections we can examine what arrows have been erased, what stories we are telling. It’s better than a frontier psychiatry of orchestra fail."
