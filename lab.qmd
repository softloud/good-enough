title: Good Enough Data & Systems Lab
---

We care about Good Enough Systems, whether they be computational or otherwise. 

The Good Enough Lab is not only a consultancy, but a community of people who advocate for trustworthiness in science. We study mathematics together, read papers, code together, and develop advocacy materials.

## Systemic Injustice Research Partners

As the Good Enough Lab's founding Systemic Injustice Research Partner, Garima Gupta's advocacy for biodiversity conservation in the Global South has helped shape the Lab's values and purpose. 

Garima Gupta is an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of biodiversity, Indigenous knowledge, and environmental justice. Her work explores how systemic and epistemic injustices shape conservation and sustainability in the Global South, with a focus on the Himalayan region. Drawing on both ecological and social science methods, she investigates community-led governance, plural knowledge systems, and reparative justice. Garima collaborates with the Good Enough Lab to co-develop inclusive, context-sensitive, and politically aware approaches to sustainability.

Garima and Charles collaborate with conservationists for justice, such as our recent publications with Associate Professor Maya Pasgaard from Aarhus University.

## Good Enough Advisors

Patrick Robotham is a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and cofounder of Prophet, a media analytics company. He advises the good enough data and systems lab on an ad hoc basis.

Dr Hannah Fraser who specialises in Questionable Research Practices and mathematician/datapunk Dr Danny Fryer also provide insightful advice from time to time. 

Many other scientists advise in big and small ways in the lab.
