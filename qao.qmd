So. 

I swear I am on the third draft of this, I have all the code snippets, the argument. 

But porting the mansucript to interoperate with the slides - and game - proved such a challenge I decided to take a more [formal approach](singularities.qmd) to how I will instantiate the QAO paper here. 

QAO paper will be presented on [March 26 Copenhagen meetup](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagen-dbt-meetup/events/306219858/?eventOrigin=your_events), so I have a firm deadline for this. It's coming. I just needed to finish the first draft of the formal approach first.
