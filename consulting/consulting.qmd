> *An algorithm is math on a blackboard—until you make it think.*

We design the living brain of structured intelligence systems (AI).

A structured intelligence system is more than code—it's people and algorithms interoperating.  
We specialise in optimising the intelligence of that process.

At the Good Enough Lab, we build data systems that don’t just scale—they think.  
System thinking is a living process: as people evolve their questions, systems must evolve with them.  
Design can’t be perfected upfront—it must be structured to adapt in a way that's observable and trustworthy for humans.

Our consulting services move organisations from chaos to coherence.  
We bring opinionated inclusivity, test-driven development, and grounded migration strategies—shaped by over a decade of experience engineering machine-learning pipelines in research, start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprise environments.

We’re not here to optimise your dashboards.  
We’re here to help you build a system of analytical inquiry you can trust.

### Data Architecture Strategy for Migration & Inclusive Automation

> *It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.*  

Most data migrations fail because they forget the humans.  
We design structured intelligence systems that reflect *real* workflows—not just schemas.

Robust systems maintain clear boundaries between **source**, **semantic**, and **analytic** layers.  
When these layers are collapsed, data reuse becomes brittle and unsustainable.

It's costly to rewrite pipelines for every analysis.  
It’s better to build a living architecture of semantically meaningful tables that grow with the organisation—  
flexible enough to recombine, stable enough to trust.

```{dot}
digraph pipeline {
  rankdir=BT
  bgcolor=transparent
  node [style=filled, fillcolor=white, shape=box]
  edge [color=white]
  raw [label="Ingestion Layer\nEnsures data freshness and source integrity"]
  source [label="Source Layer\nConverts to source-aligned data entities"]
  semantic [label="Semantic Layer\nIntegrates data entities across sources"]
  analytic [label="Analytic Layer\nEnriches data entities for specific analyses"]
  deploy [label="Deployment Layer\nValidated analyses and data exports that preserve lineage"]
  raw -> source -> semantic -> analytic -> deploy
}
```


Our Structured Intelligence Governance starter kit, tailored to **your stack**, includes:

- Test-driven data migration plan (the Lab uses JIRA inhouse, and have experience with ClickUp and Monday)  
- [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data entity modelling (we favour DBT, git-based, cloud-native approaches)  
- Embedded validation and observability  
- ESG-aligned governance scaffolds

### Change Management through FAIR Audits

You don’t need another compliance checklist.  
You need to know whether your system is FAIR *to the people inside it*.

We conduct in-depth audits—person by person, role by role—to uncover how data practices actually function.  
We map epistemic flows, surface systemic blockers, and design transitions that earn trust.

- [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) workflow audit  
- Sociotechnical validation plan  
- Governance recommendations grounded in lived experience

> This is change management that builds trust *before* transformation.

### Speaking & Advisory

Structured intelligence isn’t just a technical upgrade.  
It’s a shift in how we understand machines, data, and each other.

We offer:

- Keynotes on the brain of structured intelligence systems (AI)  
- Executive briefings on test-driven governance and epistemic resilience

> Your intelligence system has a nervous system.  
We help you wire it wisely.
