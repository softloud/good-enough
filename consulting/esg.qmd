## ESG is a Data Governance Problem

The Good Enough Data & Systems Lab builds structured intelligence systems that meet the demands of enterprise-scale ESG compliance—without compromising human context, traceability, or epistemic trust.

We specialise in:

- ESG-aligned system migration
- FAIR-by-design data architecture
- Test-driven governance scaffolds
- Epistemic validation across human–algorithm systems

We don’t do checkbox compliance.  
We engineer systems that **make ESG claims trustworthy**.

## Why FAIR?

The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), and the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities all demand transparency, traceability, and semantic clarity.

But they don’t tell you **how to build the system** that delivers this.

We do.

The [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable—are the backbone of our approach.  
We model data systems that are:

- Compliant by construction  
- Auditable by role  
- Aligned with lived workflows  
- Robust to epistemic drift

> FAIR isn’t just a technical standard. It’s how trust enters the system.
